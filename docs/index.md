# TestGAQSVM docs

This repository experiments with **Genetic Algorithm (GA) synthesis of quantum feature maps** and **QSVM** classification, using the local `qoop/` codebase (quantum circuit evolution utilities) and scripts/notebooks in the repo root.

## Where to start

- If you want to reproduce the notebook pipeline, read `pipeline-testH.md`.
- If you’re setting up the environment, read `getting-started.md`.
- If you want a map of the code, read `repo-structure.md`.
- If something fails to import/run, read `troubleshooting.md`.
